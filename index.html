        <p><a href="https://www.x-rayspex.com/polystyrene" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Poly Styrene</a> was a British musician, singer-songwriter, and frontwoman for the punk rock band X-Ray Spex.</p>
        <p>She was born in 1957 to a Scottish-Irish mother and Somali father. At 15, Poly ran away from home and hitchhiked to music festivals. She decided to start X-Ray Spex on her 19th birthday after seeing the Sex Pistols perform.</p>
        <p>Poly and her band injected a much-needed burst of color and fun into a punk scene that was increasingly nihilistic and destructive. Although not lacking the necessary anger and energy to make it on the scene. X-ray Spex never took themselves too seriously, and soon distinguished themselves by their difference to the rest. Poly herself wasnâ€™t the archetypal pop princess. This unconventionally pretty youth with short hair, tooth-braces and a war-helmet perched cockily on her head was the tank-girl-rebel long inspiring a horde of riot-girl queens to this day.</p>
