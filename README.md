# Poly Styrene

![Poly Styrene](img/screenshot.png)

[Poly Styrene Tribute](https://bealearnscode.github.io/poly-styrene-tribute/) is a, you guessed it, tribute page for punk icon and [X-Ray Spex](https://www.x-rayspex.com/) frontwoman, the late  Marianne Joan Elliot-Said, aka Poly Styrene.

I created this little page as part of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design certificate.
